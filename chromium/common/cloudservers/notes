CloudService
  does authentication
  hides re-authentication
  hides polling behind wait()
  is a factory for managers

EntityManager
  handles a subclass of Entity
  has subclasses
  all CRUD should have an optional callback function which gets called once
    the operation completes

Entity
  has subclasses

EntityList
  no subclasses
  needs a eachAsync(function(entity)) so we aren't stuck blocking to loop
    through the list.

$.ajax has access to request&response headers, and returns the xhr object
so you can abort or monitor the request.

xhr is forbidden, duh.

when jsonp api exists, js bindings will be useful everywhere.  until then,
people will have to proxy the requests.

also, extensions can use it, and when it turns into a hosted app on
rackspace, it won't be XHR anymore. (?)


will need to handle localization myself, since chrome and ff do it
differently.

OK 1. Verify that cross-site XHR is OK within an HTML FF page.
OK 2. Write a minimal js bindings.
OK 3. Make Chrome and FF extensions that use them.
4. Extend js bindings.
5. Write localization.
   If this fails, we can fall back to XUL and Chrome-style l10n.

localization: rel="__MSG_xyz" gets innertext filled by getMessage("xyz")?

will be several files during development, but we'll want to ship it out as
a single JS file at the end.
