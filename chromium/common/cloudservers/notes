when jsonp api exists, js bindings will be useful everywhere.  until then,
people will have to proxy the requests.

also, extensions can use it, and when it turns into a hosted app on
rackspace, it won't be XHR anymore. (?)

will need to handle localization myself, since chrome and ff do it
differently.

OK 1. Verify that cross-site XHR is OK within an HTML FF page.
OK 2. Write a minimal js bindings.
OK 3. Make Chrome and FF extensions that use them.
4. Extend js bindings.
5. Write localization.
   If this fails, we can fall back to XUL and Chrome-style l10n.

localization: rel="__MSG_xyz" gets innertext filled by getMessage("xyz")?

will be several files during development, but we'll want to ship it out as
a single JS file at the end.

Create should return as soon as it gets a response from the server, because
the entity is mostly created at that point.  After that, you can wait() if you
wish on the BUILD or whatever.  Maybe make an option to create()?

notify maybe needs to be rewritten because you can't rely on the LM date of lists
  (or maybe that's a bug in the API that needs fixing.)

possible bug: if i get a 503 back, it's in XML, which barfs because i can't
parse the JSON (of course).  Either make the API return JSON, or be able to
handle 500s separately.

get answers from jorge about 503 and delta()
