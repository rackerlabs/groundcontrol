Fault

$.ajax has access to request&response headers, and returns the xhr object
so you can abort or monitor the request.

xhr is forbidden, duh.

when jsonp api exists, js bindings will be useful everywhere.  until then,
people will have to proxy the requests.

also, extensions can use it, and when it turns into a hosted app on
rackspace, it won't be XHR anymore. (?)

c36ec1e44e2e2947f8e155a3a122a359 is api key

will need to handle localization myself, since chrome and ff do it
differently.

1. Verify that cross-site XHR is OK within an HTML FF page.
2. Write a minimal js bindings.
3. Make Chrome and FF extensions that use them.
4. Extend js bindings.
5. Write localization.
   If this fails, we can fall back to XUL and Chrome-style l10n.

localization: rel="__MSG_xyz" gets innertext filled by getMessage("xyz").

will be several files during development, but we'll want to ship it out as
a single JS file at the end.
